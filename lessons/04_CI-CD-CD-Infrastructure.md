## About
The following articles should explain what are all these processes:

## The Tools
There are specialized tools that can be used to achieve Continuous Integration, Delivery and even Deployment. But that's not the whole story. Many source control, build, orchestration, provisioning and even testing tools are used to achieve Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment. There are also services that offer specialized features to achieve the same objectives.

Probably the most known specialized CI/CD systems are Jenkins, Travis (used a lot in GitHub stored projects), GitLab CI (now fully integrated part of GitLab).

## Gitlab and Jenkins
For experiencing the CI/CD/CD processes, we'll be working with GitLab and Jenkins.

### GitLab
